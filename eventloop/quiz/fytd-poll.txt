- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

In eventloop/poll.js, the order of execution will be as follows:

foo is logged to the console.
done is logged to the console.
Read Error is logged to the console.
Brief explanation of the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases:

The code runs synchronously on the main thread.
The I/O operation in someAsyncOperation() is queued to the poll phase of the event loop.
foo() is executed, logging "foo" to the console.
"done" is logged to the console.
After the operations on the main thread are completed, the event loop is executed.
The operation in the queue of the poll phase is executed, resulting in fs.readFile being executed.
"Read Error" is logged to the console.
